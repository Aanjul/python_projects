# For refrence https://github.com/OmkarPathak/Python-Programs/blob/master/Scripts/P09_ReminderApplication.py

# This application was developed as I cannot remember for birthdays efficiently.
# This app helps me remind birthdays and notifies me on their birthdays.

# To store birthdays ceate a file 'reminder.data' and store birthdays in this format:
# MonthDay Name Surname

# Copy the python file to /bin:
#   sudo cp -i /path/to/your_script.py /bin
#   (your_script.py should be executable)
# Add A New Cron Job:
#   sudo crontab -e
# Scroll to the bottom and add the following line (after all the #'s):
#   @reboot python /bin/your_script.py &
# And Reboot to check if the script is working

# Or simply search for 'Startup applications' and add you script there
