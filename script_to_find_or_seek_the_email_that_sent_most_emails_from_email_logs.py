# Seeking email that sent the most emails from email logs (text file)

# 1. Request file name
fname = raw_input('Enter file name: ')

# 2. File handle

# 3. Create dictionary

# 5. Loop through each sentence

	# shows position 2 has emails

	# 9. Map key-value pairs to dictionary
	counts[email] = counts.get(email, 0) + 1
	
	# print counts
	# shows you have a dictionary with key-value pairs of format email:count
